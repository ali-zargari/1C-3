FEEDBACK:

Good simulation of browser behavior via the Navigator class. 


Efficient implementation of clearing the stack. 
    Make sure to keep track of changes in the state of the StackList 
	instance via a instance variable such as modCount. In this way 
	when iterator's next() method is called, we can check that the 
	Iterator is in a valid state.
	

In pop() method check when user pops from an empty
   stack. Throw an exception which the user has to
   handle (Note: here the user is the Navigator class).
   
   For example:
    public E pop() throws NoSuchElementException
    {
        if(top == null) // Note: A method call adds unnecessary overhead.
        {
            throw new NoSuchElementException();
        }
        else
        {
                Node temp = top;
        
-1 class StackList does not initialize required instance variable "name".
   See the project description:
   "The toString() method should include the name of the stack passed in by the 
   Navigator class in addition to the number of links in the stack."
   
   Set the argument of the constructor to the name of the stack. 
   Otherwise, it is difficult to identify the stack you are displaying.
   Also see sample output in project description.


+0.5 Good testing of your implementation especially with creative link names!
